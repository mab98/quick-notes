### JavaScript Deep Dive

* When accessing properties of the global object in the browser, you can omit the `window.` reference — it's implied.
* Use `globalThis` to reliably reference the global object in any JavaScript environment (browser or Node.js).
* Assigning a value without declaring it using `var`, `let`, or `const` implicitly creates a property on the global object.
* Defining a variable with the same name as an existing global object property (e.g., `alert`, `location`) can override its functionality, potentially causing runtime errors like `TypeError`.

#### JavaScript Execution Modes:

1. **Sloppy Mode**

   * Default mode for scripts.
   * More lenient; allows potentially unsafe or ambiguous behavior.

2. **Strict Mode**

   * Enabled by adding `"use strict";` at the top of a file or function.
   * Catches common mistakes and throws errors to avoid pitfalls.
   * Prevents silent errors, disallows undeclared variables, and more.

#### Hoisting in JavaScript:

* **Hoisting** refers to JavaScript's behavior of moving variable declarations to the top of their scope during compilation.
* Only **declarations** (e.g., `var x;`) are hoisted, **not initializations** (e.g., `x = 5;`).
* The "scope" is the context (global or function) in which the variable exists.
* In strict mode, some of the quirks of `var` hoisting are addressed, but it doesn’t eliminate hoisting entirely.
variables declared by let and const are not hoisted.
